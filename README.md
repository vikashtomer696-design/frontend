# Steamshot Foundry

## High-Concept
*Steamshot Foundry* is a fast-paced mobile puzzle game set inside a roaring steampunk factory. Players manage two parallel ammo lanes of glowing, colored blobs that feed a central firing chamber, which blasts at a constantly scrolling wall of colored pixel blocks. Match colors to clear pixels, reveal hidden pixel art masterpieces, and keep the factory running at full throttle. Mistakes overheat the system and accelerate the wall, pushing players into tense, high-skill recoveries.

## Core Gameplay Loop
1. **Queue & Manage Ammo**: Colored blobs advance down two parallel lanes toward a central firing chamber.
2. **Swap Lanes**: A lane-swapping diverter lets players switch blobs between lanes to line up the right colors.
3. **Fire at the Wall**: The chamber shoots blobs at the scrolling pixel wall. Matching colors clear pixels; mismatches cause the wall to speed up.
4. **Reveal Masterpieces**: Clearing pixels reveals hidden pixel art restorations that unlock progression and upgrades.

## Key Mechanics
### Dual Ammo Lanes
* Two independent lanes feed the chamber, creating simultaneous planning pressure.
* The diverter allows instant swaps to correct sequencing or set up combos.

### Blob Fusion (Mega-Blobs)
* Adjacent same-color blobs can be fused into a **Mega-Blob**.
* Mega-Blobs clear a larger pixel area and can pierce a short distance if aligned.
* Fusion adds strategic risk: wait too long and the wall accelerates.

### Streak-Based Overdrive
* Consecutive correct matches build a **Streak Meter**.
* Hitting thresholds triggers **Overdrive**, speeding shots and slowing the pixel wall.
* Overdrive grants temporary auto-fusion or bonus Mega-Blob creation.

## Progression & Meta
### Pixel Masterpieces
* Each level hides a pixel art restoration behind the block wall.
* Fully clearing the wall reveals the masterpiece and unlocks the next factory wing.

### Factory Upgrades
* Restore art to earn **Blueprints** and **Gears** for upgrades:
  * **Faster Diverter**: quicker swaps between lanes.
  * **Chamber Cooling**: reduces wall speed penalty on mistakes.
  * **Fusion Coils**: increases Mega-Blob size or pierce length.
  * **Overdrive Capacitors**: extends Overdrive duration.

## Tension & Difficulty Curve
* The wall advances at a steady tempo that tightens with player errors.
* Higher levels add more colors, tighter patterns, and special block types (e.g., armored pixels that need Mega-Blobs).

## Visual & Audio Style
* **Visuals**: Brass pipes, glowing gauges, and pixelated art unveiling beneath steam clouds.
* **Audio**: Clanking machinery, pressure hisses, and rhythmic firing beats synced to the game speed.

## Why It’s Fun
* Constant action from the dual-lane management.
* Satisfying reveals of pixel art rewards.
* Combo-driven Overdrive moments for high-skill play.
